# COMP30024-Project
"Watch your Back" for Artificial Intelligence COMP30024
=======================================================

This is the main project for the course COMP30024 Artificial Intelligence at The University of Melbourne Semester 1, 2018.
The project consisted of a game playing agent written in Python 3.6 that would be able to play the game "Watch Your Back!": a board game not unlike checkers. The [rules of the game can be found here](https://github.com/samuel-x/Watch-Your-Back/blob/master/rules.pdf). Similarly to the project in COMP10001 Foundations of Computing, a portion of the marks would be given depending on how well your agent played against other players. 

More information about the game can be found in the [Part A Spec](https://github.com/samuel-x/Watch-Your-Back/blob/master/Part%20A%20Spec.pdf) and the [Part B Spec](https://github.com/samuel-x/Watch-Your-Back/blob/master/Part%20B%20Spec.pdf).

The game had a major flaw in which balance was strongly skewed to whoever had the first move, which resulted in many players just placing pieces near the center of the board and holding the center until the game finished. Additionally, the assignment required the program to be written in Python 3.6 and complete the game within certain memory/time limitations that seemed a bit unrealistic for non-compiled Python. However, it was fun to be given a lot of freedom towards tackling the problem since we were allowed to use any method to complete the game.

All in all, the project was pretty fun. Good luck!
