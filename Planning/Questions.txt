- Leaf nodes that result in wins or losses need to not propogate additional wins.
- Games eventually lead to draws due to the PUBG mechanic. How to handle draws?
	One shrinkage after move 128.
	Another after move 196.

- Look at python picke module for possibly serializing and deserializing the MCTS tree.
	https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pickle.html#module-pickle

- Look after scenarios where we have the delta and need a reference to the play maker and we did 
	that using delta.move_origin.occupant.owner. Replace that with the new delta.player.

- Clean up which methods require square vs position references.
	It's a bit strange for instance methods simply to return position references, as it'd be
	unrelated to the instance itself.
		Make them static methods? Make them return squares instead?
